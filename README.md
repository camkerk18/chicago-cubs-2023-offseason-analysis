# Project Description

This repository contains the analysis of the Chicago Cubs 2023 Offseason by examining their 2022 performance through the use of run differential, on-base percentage (OBP), and earned run average (ERA). Current roster (2022), pending free agents, possible acquisitions, and financial constraint were used to project the Chicago Cubs roster for the 2023 season. Minimal projected improvement in win total was found, thus concluding in a likely failure to reach the postseason.
